    "By specifying `pre_offset_search : false` and values for `start` and `stop` for `time_offset`. In that case, the script will scan the number of coincidences between MAGIC and LST-1 as a function of the time offset (from `start` to `stop` in steps of 0.1 us) in a time window defined by `2*window_half_width`. Then the time offset value giving the highest number of coincidences is found (or the mean of the time offsets giving the same highest number of coincidences), let's call it $t_\\text{offset,max}$. The final value of the time offset is computed as the weithed average of the time offsets within `4*window_half_width` (i.e. twice the time window) centered on $t_\\text{offset,max}$. The weights are the number of coincidences on those time offsets.\n",

    "- compute all possible time combinations (N x N) between extracted MAGIC/LST events\n",
    "- search the best time offset by counting the number of coincident events using N x N events with an assumption of one of the offset combinations\n",
    "- when the best time offset is found by the pre-offset search, the final time offset is found from the scan as in the standard coincidence search\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, use `window_half_width` to tell the script the range over which it will search for coincident events. This is useful when one does not know the time offset. Still, one needs to have an idea of the time offset (even if not precisely). For example, if there is a time offset of seconds, the default window half width is not enough."
