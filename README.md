# LST Analysis School 2024

Repository containing notebooks and other files used during the 2nd LST Analysis School, 5-8 February 2024. The notebooks are mostly taken from the lstchain repository and are meant to be run on the La Palma cluster. 

Since I do not have writing permissions in the school directory on the cluster,  I have fixed some paths to adapt them to my folder structure. The paths in the notebooks are now set up so that any output is stored in a `output/` subdirectory of the notebook folder. Notebook output is not included in the repo because of GitHub memory limitations.

Slides and instructions to run the notebooks are on the school Indico: https://indico.cta-observatory.org/event/5272/
